// AddControllers() is different from AddControllersWithViews().
// AddControllers() is added as a service in this container because the controllers in the Controllers folder also
// contain methods or actions that are for API purposes, not just for returning Views.
// In this system, Inventory System, the ProductsController in the Controllers folder contain actions or methods both for returning
// Views and API routes. And since the ProductsController handles both MVC View routes and API routes, the AddControllers() service
// should be added in the container as you can see below. But if "ALL" the Controllers in a specific system are only used for
// returning Views, then AddControllers() doesn't need to be added in the containera anymore. It is added down below because
// the Contollers in this system, particularly in ProductsController, contains both MVC Views routes and API routes.
// If you observe ProductsController, it is inheriting from Controller class and not ControllerBase, because that contoller is used
// both for MVC Views routes and API routes. Meaning, it contain methods/actions that return Views, perform CRUDS operations,
// and methods/action for API routes/API endpoints, which are used by other system such as EcommerceSystem to connect or integrate
// with this system, the INventory system.
